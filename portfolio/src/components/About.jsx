          I am studing at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. My major is Intelligence Electronics. I started learning front-end technologies like 
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I am looking for an internship to gain experience in the field of web development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer. 
          While studing I learn a bit of Python, VHDL, Verilog, C#. In one of my projects, I was a participiant in building .NET WebAssembly application with Razor Pages and MudBlazor components.
